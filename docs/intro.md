# Balena Security

### Mission Statement

## What is this repo ?

This repository serves as a place for storing and revising artifacts we produced as a result of improvements/topics in [Jellyfish](https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish).

By having reports, risks, and policy documented in this repository, we can easily collaborate on document files, share tooling and review changes with a distributed team.

## How do we work ?

The team works by maintaining 2 road maps in the form of **Sagas**. These sagas contain **Improvements** we have decided to work on.

### Security X.0 Saga

This is the current roadmap being worked on. The `X.0` will be replaced by the current revision being worked on, for example; Security 1.0 defines the first road map.

Improvements from the _Security Next Saga_ can be moved into the current saga at any time but must follow the [Commitment Adjustment Policy](#commitment-adjustment-policy) that ensures we are meeting goals.

### Security Next Saga

This roadmap contains Improvements we think should be worked on eventually but not right away.

## Jellyfish Idioms

Please reference the [Contributing Page](/contributing) to understand how Jellyfish works. These rules are not specific to our team but we want to standardize how we use the platform.

## Commitment Adjustment Policy

WIP ...how do we decided to add something to our roadmap after deciding on the current roster ?
