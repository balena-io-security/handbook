This document explains how we think Jellyfish is suppose to be used.

## How are Sagas used as a road map ?

Each Saga will contain a list of Improvements that were a result of discussing a **Brainstorm Topic** from a **Brainstorm Call** OR a member of the team may manually add an improvement async.

## How are Improvements used ?

Improvements will contain **Milestones** to track actionable items. Milestones will usually be attached to Pull Requests in this repository.

Improvements can be created without a topic but ideally were inspired by a discussion the team had. Improvements will begin as Proposed and move to Researching (Drafting Spec) when the team agrees it's worth doing. Improvements by default go into the backlog Saga unless agreed it can be put into the active saga.

## How are Topics used ?

Topics store a question/concern not a description of a thing. They also must not include a suggested solution. This is to ensure conversations about the problem are not biased.

You can create a topic and add it to the appropriate category so during the next call it gets reviewed. For example, create a topic and adding it to `balena-io security` ensures the security loop looks at the topic.

Threads are used to keep track of important information or discussions about the topic. Threads can also be used as logs for comment/decisions made during a call.

## How are Brainstorm Calls used ?

Brainstorm calls are used to track meetings (scheduled or adhoc) which discuss topics. Topics can be added in real time during the call or async.

If a topic is discussed, the topic most applicable is re-used, not a new one!

## What if a Topic does not need an Improvement ?

Brainstorm Topics that do not make an Improvement are fine! We do not expect every piece of work we do produce an artifact/revision. These topics however can still be useful logs of ideas/discussions/concerns and live as examples of conclusions we have reached.
